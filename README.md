# ale - raggi's brew taps

These formulae provide software either written by me, or tap'd by me. Use at
your own discretion.

How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap raggi/ale` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install raggi/ale/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/raggi/ale/master/<formula>.rb
```
